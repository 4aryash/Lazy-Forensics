# Lazy-Forensics
A bash script to automate repetition and save time while solving Forensic Challenges in a CTF.

### Important
Follow the instructions in Usage-Readme.txt to run the tool properly. <br>

## Working
Some of the tools used come pre-installed with OS's like Kali Linux or Parrot, while other distros of Linux are required to install them.<br>
After setting up all the requirements, execute the run.sh program with files(preferably JPEG, JPG, PNG, BMP, TXT, etc). <br>
The output of the script is stored in a log.txt file so as to save time and repetition while analyzing a file.

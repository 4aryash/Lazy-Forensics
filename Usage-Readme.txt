Step 1: chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
Step 2: ./run.sh <filename.xyz> <min-length>

You could also just add the run.sh program as an alias, by appending the .bashrc file in your home directory.

Steps to create an Alias:
1. cd $HOME
2. nano .bashrc
3. alias lazyforen6='bash /home/dirtyvibe/qwerty/Lazy-Forensics/run.sh'         #change this line
4. Save the file.

USAGE Example: lazyforen6 file.png 9

Now you can run the script from anywhere in your terminal.
Nice and quick!
